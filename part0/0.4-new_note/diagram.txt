Q: What happens when the user submits a "New Note" form?

In the previous example, when the user typed something in the form and submitted it, the server would fetch the new note's contenet via JSON from the browser and store in a database. Then, instead of putting the new note in the browser directly using the DOM, the server would reload the webpage, and then finally the new note would show up.

However, most web applications don't work like that anymore: oftentimes, when the user submits something, the content travels to the server and the new content shows up instantly through DOM manipulation. It's more efficient: you won't have to reload the webpage and fetch everything over again just because you pressed a button. Imagine a really interactive webpage with several actions--you would have to reload for each little thing you do.
